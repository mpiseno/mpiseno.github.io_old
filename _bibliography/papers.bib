  abstract={Obtaining controllers for high-dimensional continuous control of humanoid robots remains a challenging problem. Reinforcement learning has shown promise as a general method for learning locomotion controllers across a diverse range of different motions and in different environments, however specifying a reward function and transferring to real hardware remain open challenges. In this work, we build upon Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP) and introduce a framework that learns a reward function using a small amount of motion capture data. Using this reward function, we are able to learn a single multi-task controller for humanoid locomotion that produces natural-looking behavior for several different motions. Moreover, our controller produces energy-efficient motions without explicitly optimizing for such terms, is able to transition smoothly between different motions, and is capable of deploying on real hardware using a custom domain randomization procedure.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
