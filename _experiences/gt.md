## So Neural Networks...

I thought I knew all about neural networks after taking Andrew Ng's famous Coursera ML course. But I didn't *really* know how neural networks worked until taking and then teaching CS 7643: Deep Learning at Georgia Tech. As a teaching assistant (TA), it was my responsibility to create, maintain, and teach material including but not limited to:

* Optimization: SGD, Adam, RMSProp, Momentum, Automatic differentiation
* Vision Models: CNNs, Pooling, Transpose convolutions
* Sequence Models: LSTMs, GRUs, Transformers
* Generative Models: VAEs, GANs
* Deep RL: DQN, Policy Gradients, Actor-Critic methods

It was quite difficult to learn all the material at a level which I was comfortable explaining it to PhD students, but after two years of teaching the course it became routine.

## What I Did

I hosted office hours for one hour every week to help students with homework or general questions on the course material. I also split up grading among the other TAs. In my final two semesters of teaching the course, I began taking more of a leadership role on the TA team, often aiding in important decisions regarding couse logistics and creating content like high-quality problem set solutions (which unfortunately I cannot show off, but trust me they're quite detailed).

I also created a blog to explain confusing concepts related to the course material which can be viewed in the blog section of my website. For example, [this](https://www.michaelpiseno.com/blog/2020/conv-backprop/) tutorial on backpropagation through convolutional layers. I even created [a tutorial in Chinese](https://www.michaelpiseno.com/blog/2021/%E7%AD%96%E7%95%A5%E6%A2%AF%E5%BA%A6/) covering policy gradients, admittedly mostly to practice my Chinese skills.

## In Conclusion

TAing was only of my most formative experience in college. Besides learning a plethora of difficult math and AI concepts, I developed my interpersonal skills in dealing with students who were struggling. I also developed my leadership skills when voicing my opinions on key decisions and taking on greater responsibility in maintaining course materials.
