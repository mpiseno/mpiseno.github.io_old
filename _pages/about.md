###### <b>About Me</b>

I am a MS student at Stanford University studying computer science. I am interested in robots that are cabaple of learning generally intelligent behaviors and that interact intelligently with humans and other agents.

I attended the University of Georgia for one year before transferring to Georgia Tech, where I received my BS in computer science with highest honors and a minor in mathematics. At GT, I was a teaching assistant for [CS 7643: Deep Learning](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2021/cs7643_fall/), a Senior Class Representative in student government, and a member of the board of directors in [SHPE](https://gt-shpe.com/).

###### <b>Research Interests</b>

I work at the intersection of reinforcement learning and robotics. I am interested in developing algorithms that allow robots to interact with both humans and other agents in intelligent ways. More specificically, I am interested in modeling multi-agent systems that can operate and adapt in dynamic real-world (or extraterrestrial) environments.

###### <b>Background and Personal Interests</b>

I grew up in low-income community just south of Atlanta where we lacked many educational opportunities. While in college, I founded [Fractal](https://www.fractalcs.org/), a nonprofit dedicated to promoting CS education in low-income communities.

In my free time, I love snowboarding, playing volleyball, and learning languages. I speak Spanish and Chinese (Mandarin) conversationally.
