###### <b>About Me</b>

<p align="justify">
I am a MS in Computer Science at Stanford University advised by <a href="https://dorsa.fyi/" target="_blank">Dorsa Sadigh</a>. I work on AI and robotics in the <a href="https://iliad.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Intelligent and Interactive Autonomous Systems Group (ILIAD)</a>. I also spend time at Google Brain working on robot locomotion. I am broadly interested in developing intelligent robotic systems. My research is supported by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DoD_NDSEG_Fellowship" target="_blank">National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG)</a> Fellowship.

<!-- <p align="justify">
Outside research, I co-created <a href="https://www.popcornapp.io/" target="_blank">Popcorn</a>, a Q&A platform for classes.

Prior to Stanford, I attended the University of Georgia for one year before transferring to Georgia Tech, where I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. I TAed <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2021/cs7643_fall/" target="_blank">CS 7643</a> (Deep Learning) at Georgia Tech for two years.
