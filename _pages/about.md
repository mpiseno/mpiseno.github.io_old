###### <b>About Me</b>

I am a 5th year undergraduate student at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/) studying Computer Science and Mathematics. I am broadly interested in AI and Robotics that interact with humans and other intelligent agents. I am also passionate about the startup landscape and education. On campus, I am a teaching assistant for [CS 7643: Deep Learning](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2021/cs7643_fall/), a Senior Class Representative in student government, and a member of the board of directors in [SHPE](https://gt-shpe.com/).

###### <b>Research Interests</b>

I am interested in developing AI that interacts collaboratively with both humans and other intelligent agents and transferring these systems to real robots. More specificically, I am interested in modeling multi-agent systems that can operate in dynamic and stochastic real-world environments. This lands me at the intersection of multi-agent RL and robotics.

###### <b>Personal Interests</b>

I am passionate about education in low-income communities because I grew up on the south side of Atlanta where educational opportunities were comparatively deficient. I founded [Fractal](https://www.fractalcs.org/), a nonprofit dedicated to promoting CS education in low-income communities.

In my free time, I love snowboarding and learning languages. I speak Chinese (Mandarin) and Spanish conversationally.
