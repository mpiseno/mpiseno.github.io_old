###### <b>About Me</b>

I am a Master's student in the CS department at Stanford University. I work on AI and robotics in the <a href="https://iliad.stanford.edu/">Intelligent and Interactive Autonomous Systems Group (ILIAD)</a>, advised by <a href="https://dorsa.fyi/">Dorsa Sadigh</a>.

I am interested in robots that learn complex tasks and demonstrate generalized intelligence. The goal of my research is to develop intelligent agile robots that can perform tasks with human-like accuracy.

Before Stanford, I attended the University of Georgia for one year before transferring to Georgia Tech, where I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. At GT I was a TA for [CS 7643: Deep Learning](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2021/cs7643_fall/). I have spent time in various research and ML engineering roles at IBM Research, Dropbox, Facebook AI Research (FAIR), A9, and Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI). I was also previously a TA for [CS 221](https://stanford-cs221.github.io/autumn2021/) at Stanford.
