###### <b>About Me</b>

<p align="justify">
I am a Master's student in Computer Science at Stanford University. I work on AI and robotics in the <a href="https://iliad.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Intelligent and Interactive Autonomous Systems Group (ILIAD)</a>, advised by <a href="https://dorsa.fyi/" target="_blank">Dorsa Sadigh</a>.<!-- I am a research intern on the robotics team at Google Brain. --> I also co-founded <a href="https://www.popcornapp.io/" target="_blank">Popcorn</a>, a Q&A platform for classes.

</p>

<p align="justify">
I am interested in robots that learn complex tasks and demonstrate generalized intelligence. The goal of my research is to develop intelligent agile robots that can perform tasks with human-like accuracy.

Prior to Stanford, I attended the University of Georgia for one year before transferring to Georgia Tech, where I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. I have spent time in various research and ML engineering roles at IBM Research, Dropbox, Facebook AI Research (FAIR), A9, and Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI). I was also previously a TA for <a href="https://stanford-cs221.github.io/autumn2021/" target="_blank">CS 221</a> at Stanford and for <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2021/cs7643_fall/" target="_blank">CS 7643: Deep Learning</a> at Georgia Tech.
