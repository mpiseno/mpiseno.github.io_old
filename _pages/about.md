###### <b>About Me</b>

I am a first year Computer Science MS student at Stanford University. I am interested in robots that are able to learn complex behaviors and solve tasks in intelligent ways. I have also worked on research and ML engineering at <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/experience/">various companies</a>.

<!-- I am a first year Computer Science MS student at Stanford University. My research focuses on developing robots cabale of learning complex behaviors and solving tasks in intelligent ways. I am the president of the Stanford Robotics Club and co-founder of Popcorn (YC W22) and have worked on research and ML engineering at various companies. -->

I attended the University of Georgia for one year before transferring to Georgia Tech, where I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. While attending GT, I was a teaching assistant for [CS 7643: Deep Learning](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2021/cs7643_fall/).

<!-- ###### <b>Research Interests</b>

I am interested in developing algorithms that allow robots to intelligently perform complex tasks. I am also interested in robots that can handle changing environment conditions and that can collaborate. For example, a robot that learns to traverse hazardous terrain to move materials between two locations along with humans and other robots.

Ultimately, I am interested in utilizing advances in intelligent robotics for planetary exploration and to automate dangerous and repetitive tasks on Earth. -->


<!-- ###### <b>Background and Personal Interests</b>

I grew up in low-income community just south of Atlanta that had very limited access to many important educational opportunities (e.g. tutoring, CS classes, language classes). Because of this, 

While in college, I founded [Fractal](https://www.fractalcs.org/), a nonprofit dedicated to promoting CS education in low-income communities.

In my free time, I love snowboarding, playing volleyball, and learning languages. I speak Spanish and Chinese (Mandarin) conversationally.  -->
