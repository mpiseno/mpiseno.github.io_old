###### <b>About Me</b>

I am a 5th year undergraduate student at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/) studying Computer Science and Mathematics. I am interested in AI and robots that interact with humans and other intelligent agents and learn broadly intelligent behavior. On campus, I am a teaching assistant for [CS 7643: Deep Learning](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2021/cs7643_fall/), a Senior Class Representative in student government, and a member of the board of directors in [SHPE](https://gt-shpe.com/). I will be starting my MS at Stanford in the Autumn 2021 quarter.

###### <b>Research Interests</b>

I work at the intersection of reinforcement learning and robotics. I am interested in developing algorithms that allow robots to interact with both humans and other agents in intelligent ways. More specificically, I am interested in modeling multi-agent systems that can operate and adapt in dynamic real-world environments.

###### <b>Personal Interests</b>

I am passionate about education in low-income communities because I am from the south side of Atlanta where educational opportunities are comparatively deficient. I founded [Fractal](https://www.fractalcs.org/), a nonprofit dedicated to promoting CS education in low-income communities.

In my free time, I love snowboarding and learning languages. I speak Chinese (Mandarin) and Spanish conversationally.
